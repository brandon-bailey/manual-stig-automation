# Manual STIG Automation

- I know, what an oxymoron.

- Give me a star if you find this useful!

- This repository is a result of what happens when a software engineer does cyber security stuff...

- These documents are from my trial and tribulations of working on the RMF process, this is by no means an exhaustive repository. If you are having a hard time with something and do not see it here feel free to create an issue and ask for something.

- I am deliberately leaving all files as .txt instead of .ps1 so that they are not mistakely run. Simply copy and paste into powershell where applicable.
